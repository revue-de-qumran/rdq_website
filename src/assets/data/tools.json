        "description": "The main goal of this website is to develop a philological dictionary that encompasses the entire vocabulary of the Dead Sea Scrolls texts and processes the material etymologically, morphologically, and semantically. The dictionary thus bridges the previously little-researched gap between Biblical and Rabbinic Hebrew and Aramaic. At the same time, it serves as the basis for the so-called reverse dictionary.",

Developed in partnership with Google, the new website gives users access to searchable, fast-loading, high-resolution images of the scrolls, as well as short explanatory videos and background information on the texts and their history.
