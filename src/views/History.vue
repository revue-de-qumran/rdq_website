            <!-- <h2>1958-1986 - Direction by Jean Carmignac</h2> -->
            <p>The Revue de Qumrân was founded in 1958 by Jean Carmignac, published by Letouzey & Ané in Paris. Its initial goal was to consolidate all publications related to the emerging Qumran studies into a single platform to prevent the immense dispersion of articles and accelerate the publication process.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The initial orientations are outlined in the first issue (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24599194" target="_blank"><i>RevQ</i> 1 (1958):3-6</a>) and can be summarized as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An <b>international</b> journal accommodating <b>multiple languages</b> (German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Latin).</li>

                <li>A commitment to <b>neutrality</b>. Open to all contributions, provided they are scientific in nature, while leaving each contributor full responsibility for their articles and proof corrections.</li>

                <li><b>Extremely rapid publication</b> to ensure that researchers benefit from the findings as quickly as possible.</li>
                
                <li><b>Non-periodical publication</b>. A new issue is released as soon as 160 pages are compiled to adapt to the pace of scientific work.</li>

                <li>Fair <b>remuneration for authors</b>. Once an issue exceeds 1,000 copies sold, authors will receive a payment of 1,000 francs per page.</li>

                <li><b>A practical working tool</b> with reviews, indexes (biblical, Qumran, and rabbinic references), tables, and bibliographies.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>While many aspects have evolved since then, the original intuitions have been preserved.</p>
            <p>The "<b>Qumran bibliography</b>" section cataloged all publications related to Qumran studies as exhaustively as possible until 2010. From that date, the electronic database provided by the <a href="https://orion.huji.ac.il/index.html" target="_blank">Orion Center for the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls and Associated Literature</a> at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which had already been ensuring the bibliography since <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24609059" target="_blank"><i>RevQ</i> 19(73) (1999):153</a>, replaced the paper version.</p>
            <p>During these years, the journal provided fundamental preliminary work for subsequent research, notably: the first elements of concordance for Hebrew (1QM) and Aramaic (1QApGn) texts, supplements to K. G. Kuhn's <em>Konkordanz zu den Qumran Texten</em>, and essential corrections to J. M. Allegro's <em>princeps</em> edition by J. Strugnell.</p>
            <br>

            <br>

            <!-- <h2>1986-2012 - Direction by Émile Puech</h2> -->
            <p>In 1977, the Revue de Qumrân changed publishers to Gabalda (Paris). After 28 years as its director, Jean Carmignac appointed a new director, Émile Puech (CNRS, EBAF), and a secretary, Florentino García Martínez (University of Groningen) (see <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24608902" target="_blank"><i>RevQ</i> 12, n°47 (1986): 325-6</a>). Jean Carmignac passed away the same year. From issue 47, an editorial board was listed in the journal, including Jean Starcky (CNRS), Joseph T. Milik (CNRS), Jerome Murphy-O'Connor, John Strugnell, and Adam S. Van der Woude. By the late 1980s, Qumran research made the journal the ideal venue for rapid publication of unpublished fragments, leaving sister journals to focus on studies on contemporary Judaism.</p>
            <br>
            <p>From issue 48 onward, the journal incorporated a "Qumran Information" section alongside the bibliography, although this was maintained for only two issues (see <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24608957" target="_blank"><i>RevQ</i> 12 (1987): 603-7</a> and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24609016" target="_blank">14 (1989): 603-7</a>).</p>
            <p>During these years, several thematic and tribute volumes were published:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Mémorial Jean Carmignac</i>, <a href="https://www-jstor-org.bases-doc.univ-lorraine.fr/stable/i24599316" target="_blank"><i>RevQ</i> 13 (1988), 691 pages</a>
                </li>
                <li><i>The Texts of Qumran and the History of the Community: Proceedings of the Groningen Congress on the Dead Sea Scrolls (20-23 August 1989)</i>, ed. by Florentino García Martínez, <i>RevQ</i> 14, n° 54-56 (1989-1990). <a href="https://www-jstor-org.bases-doc.univ-lorraine.fr/stable/i24600013" target="_blank">Volume I</a>. <a href="https://www-jstor-org.bases-doc.univ-lorraine.fr/stable/i24598458" target="_blank">Volume II</a>. <a href="https://www-jstor-org.bases-doc.univ-lorraine.fr/stable/i24598764" target="_blank">Volume III</a>.

                <li><i>Mémorial Jean Starcky. Textes et études Qumrâniens volume 1</i>, ed. by Émile Puech and Florentino García Martínez, <a href="https://www-jstor-org.bases-doc.univ-lorraine.fr/stable/i24598539" target="_blank"><i>RevQ</i> 57-58 (1991)</a>.
                </li>
                <li><i>Mémorial Jean Starcky. Textes et études Qumrâniens volume 2</i>, ed. by Émile Puech and Florentino García Martínez, <a href="https://www-jstor-org.bases-doc.univ-lorraine.fr/stable/i24607861" target="_blank"><i>RevQ</i> 59 (1992)</a>.
                </li>
                <li><i>Hommage à Józef T. Milik</i>, ed. by Florentino García Martínez and Émile Puech, <a href="https://www-jstor-org.bases-doc.univ-lorraine.fr/stable/i24600085" target="_blank"><i>RevQ</i> 65-68 (1996)</a>.

                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <p>Gradually, the journal adopted a more regular pace of two 160-page issues per year, emphasizing the fulfillment of its foundational charter. From <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24663123" target="_blank"><i>RevQ</i> 24, issue 96 (2010)</a>, after 25 years of service as secretary of the journal, Florentino García Martínez handed over the position to Corrado Martone from the University of Turin.</p>

            <!-- <h2>2012- - Direction by Frédérique Michèle Rey</h2> -->

            <p>In 2012, with issue 100, the direction of the journal was entrusted to Frédérique Michèle Rey from the University of Lorraine. The evolution of digital technologies quickly necessitated the creation of the current website (second edition). On this occasion, the site offered open-access publication of 10 fundamental articles published by the journal since its inception.</p>
            <p>The priority was to upload all issues to <a href="https://www-jstor-org.bases-doc.univ-lorraine.fr/journal/revuequmran" target="_blank">JSTOR</a>. This was accomplished in 2016. That same year, the Revue de Qumrân began being published by Peeters Publishers, who had already been responsible for printing and distribution.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Starting with issue 117 (<i>RevQ</i> 33 [2021]:3), after 10 years of work as the journal's secretary, Corrado Martone handed over the position to Eric D. Reymond (Yale University), who was already responsible for reviews. This latter task was entrusted to Elisa Uusimäki (Aarhus University) from 2021 to 2023, followed by Atar Livneh (Ben Gurion University of the Negev).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, since 2010, the journal has also hosted several thematic volumes:
                <ul>
                    <li>

            <h2>New Perspectives</h2>
            <p>In recent years, the journal's board has been renewed with a clear commitment to openness, gender balance, and the inclusion of young researchers. Moreover, the new team has worked to broaden the horizons of the journal. While, during the 1990s-2010s, the journal focused primarily on manuscript editions, epigraphy, and material reconstructions, it seemed important to reposition Qumran studies in a <strong>wider context</strong>. These manuscripts are at the crossroads of numerous fields that they have profoundly impacted: the history of biblical text transmission, the revival of Septuagint and Samaritan Pentateuch studies, the history of Hebrew and Aramaic languages, the history of early Christianity, questions related to the historical Jesus, particularly the so-called "third quest," the interpretation of Pauline writings and the new studies derived from them (New Perspectives on Paul, Paul within Judaism, etc.), the renewal of pseudepigraphical studies such as the books of Jubilees, Enoch, or the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, a radical reevaluation of texts classified as apocryphal or deuterocanonical like the books of Ben Sira or Tobit, the history of ancient text interpretation, Hebrew poetry, literary genres, Jewish liturgy, or halakhic studies. New approaches have also emerged, including cultural, sociological, feminist, postcolonial studies, and gender studies, which have provided particular insights into these texts. More recently, computational methods have further renewed approaches and enhanced our understanding of these texts. The journal aims to be at the heart of these approaches and the constant evolution of our disciplines.</p>
